# Clinical Data Transformation: CRF to SDTM
This repository contains SAS scripts and workflows developed for transforming raw Case Report Form (CRF) data into the standardized Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) format. The project includes data transformations for critical clinical domains, including Demographics (DM), Vital Signs (VS), Exposure (EX), Medical History (MH), and Disposition (DS). Each program adheres to CDISC standards to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and interoperability for clinical trials.

## Overview
This project contains SAS code and processes for transforming raw clinical data collected from Case Report Forms (CRF) into the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) format. This conversion ensures data consistency and standardization for use in clinical trial analysis and regulatory submissions. The repository includes transformations for the following domains:

- **DM**: Demographics
- **VS**: Vital Signs
- **EX**: Exposure
- **MH**: Medical History
- **DS**: Disposition

Each program follows the CDISC standards, facilitating interoperability and compliance for data reporting and submission.

## Project Details
**DM (Demographics):** Converts participant demographic data, including age, gender, and ethnicity, into the SDTM-compliant structure.

**VS (Vital Signs):** Transforms vital signs measurements, such as blood pressure and heart rate, ensuring standardized units and format.

**EX (Exposure):** Tracks participant exposure to treatments or interventions, ensuring precise records of dosing and administration.

**MH (Medical History):** Standardizes patient medical history, organizing records for consistency across clinical analysis.

**DS (Disposition):** Summarizes participant disposition information, including withdrawal, completion, or other statuses.
